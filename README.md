# Hands-on tutorial: Traffic sign classifier with Tensorflow

## Preparation steps
You can download this jupyter notebook with git from here:
`git clone https://github.com/olesalscheider/traffic-sign-tutorial`

Please follow these preparation steps before the hands-on tutorial so that you come with a prepared system:

* Please install all required dependencies:
  * Python 3
  * Jupyter
    * `pip3 install --upgrade jupyter`
  * Pillow
    * `pip3 install --upgrade pillow`
  * urllib3
    * `pip3 install --upgrade urllib3`
  * numpy
    * `pip3 install --upgrade numpy`
  * Tensorflow
    * `pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow` for the CPU variant
    * `pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu` if you have a GPU with CUDA and CUDNN support
    * More details on https://www.tensorflow.org/install/
* Download and extract the traffic sign dataset (GTSRB). Execute the first cell with Python code the jupyter notebook to do so.
